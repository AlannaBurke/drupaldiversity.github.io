### Initiatives
The Drupal Diversity Working Group (DDWG) is currently working on the following projects:
   * <a href="https://github.com/drupaldiversity/event-organizer-packet">Organizer Packet</a> A resource for organizers to help them organize and support diverse and inclusive events
   * <a href="https://github.com/drupaldiversity/administration/issues">Infrastructural improvements</a> to the DDWG website & online presence
   * BOF (Birds of a Feather) sessions at Drupalcon Baltimore that will embrace and represent the interests and identities of Drupal community members.

### Get Involved

We welcome contributors in all forms - programmers, content managers, project support staff.  However you identify as a contributor and as part of the Drupal community, there is a place for you to get involved here.



What can I do?

#### Getting started

0. Come into the #diversity-inclusion room in the Drupal Slack and say hello!
(You can get an automatic invite at <a href="http://drupalslack.herokuapp.com">http://drupalslack.herokuapp.com</a> if you need one.) If Slack doesn't work for you, you can reach out to us on twitter <a href="http://www.twitter.com/drupaldiversity">@drupaldiversity</a>

1. Join us for a meeting.  We meet in #diversity-inclusion every Thursday at 9am PST / 17:00pm UTC.  You can see our calendar of meetings and sprints below.

2. If there is an issue open in *any* of our <a href="https://github.com/drupaldiversity">github repositories</a>, it's available to be worked on. We *love* to see people in the issue queues, and welcome people jumping in wherever they feel comfortable.  We try to label issues so that newcomers can quickly find tasks that match their interests.  We borrowed this idea from <a href="https://github.com/girldevelopit/gdi-website/issues">Girl Develop It's issue queue.</a>
